## 1. Decentralized Agent Marketplace

AgentMesh is a marketplace where anyone can deploy monetized LLM agents. It transforms the traditional SaaS model into a decentralized, crypto-native service platform:

- Supports a network of agent developers  
- Offers shared infrastructure and discoverability  
- Enables composable services, not siloed apps  



## 2. Composable Monetization Logic

With **CDP Wallet**, AgentMesh enables flexible and programmable revenue sharing:

- Define per-agent revenue splits (e.g., 70/20/10 or 50/50)  
- Avoids deploying new contracts for each update  
- Payments are routed according to dynamic, on-chain logic  

This makes monetization as composable as code and supports collaborations, affiliate payouts, and infrastructure incentives.



## 3. Pay-Per-Use Agents with x402pay

**x402pay** introduces per-interaction billing, simplifying access and monetization:

- No logins, subscriptions, or centralized payment systems  
- Users pay directly for each request  
- Developers focus solely on model logic, not billing infrastructure  

This redefines SaaS as a true "API economy," where AI becomes a pay-as-you-go utility.



## 4. Decentralized Compute with Akash (Optional)

**Akash** provides permissionless compute as a hosting layer:

- Reduces dependence on centralized cloud providers  
- Lowers hosting costs and risk  
- Enables compute-based revenue sharing  

This brings true infrastructure decentralization to AI agent deployment.
