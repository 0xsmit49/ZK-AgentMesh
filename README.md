## **x402pay Integration with CDP & Amazon Nova**

### **Micropayment Infrastructure**
The x402pay integration provides seamless micropayments for agent services without requiring user accounts or traditional payment processing.

**Core Components:**
- **Payment Channels**: Lightning Network-style channels for instant payments
- **Revenue Splitting**: Automated distribution via CDP Wallet programmable splits
- **Gas Optimization**: Amazon Nova's compute pricing integrated with payment flow

### **CDP Wallet Integration**
```typescript
// Revenue splitting configuration
const revenueConfig = {
  agentCreator: 40,     // 40% to agent creator
  proofProvider: 30,    // 30% to proof inheritance chain
  platform: 20,        // 20% to platform maintenance
  validators: 10        // 10% to proof validators
}

// Automated split execution
await cdpWallet.executeSplit({
  amount: paymentAmount,
  recipients: calculateRecipients(revenueConfig),
  trigger: 'proof_verification_complete'
})
```

### **Amazon Nova Compute Integration**
- **Cost-Aware Scheduling**: Dynamic pricing based on Nova's compute costs
- **Payment Routing**: Direct integration between x402pay and Nova billing
- **Resource Optimization**: Automatic scaling based on payment volume
- **Privacy Preservation**: SGX attestation for sensitive computations

**Payment Flow:**
1. User initiates agent request with x402pay micropayment
2. Payment is held in escrow during execution
3. Agent runs in Nova SGX environment with cost tracking
4. Upon completion, payment is released and split via CDP Wallet
5. Proof inheritance creators receive royalties automatically

### **Implementation Details**
```javascript
// x402pay payment initialization
const paymentChannel = await x402pay.createChannel({
  amount: estimatedCost,
  recipient: agentWallet,
  metadata: {
    agentId: selectedAgent.id,
    executionType: 'sgx_verified',
    inheritanceChain: proofInheritanceIds
  }
})

// Nova compute reservation
const computeReservation = await nova.reserveCompute({
  type: 'sgx_enabled',
  duration: estimatedRuntime,
  paymentChannel: paymentChannel.id
})
```

This integration ensures that agent creators are fairly compensated, proof inheritance is economically incentivized, and the entire system operates without traditional payment friction while maintaining privacy and security through SGX and zero-knowledge proofs.

## **Deployment Architecture**

### **IPFS Integration Example**
```typescript
// Store agent data on IPFS
const storeAgentOnIPFS = async (agentData) => {
  const metadata = {
    ...agentData,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    ipfsVersion: "1.0"
  }
  
  const result = await pinata.pinJSONToIPFS(metadata, {
    pinataMetadata: {
      name: `agent-${agentData.id}`,
      keyvalues: {
        type: 'agent_registry',
        verification_level: agentData.verificationLevel
      }
    }
  })
  
  return result.IpfsHash
}

// Retrieve agent data from IPFS
const getAgentFromIPFS = async (ipfsHash) => {
  const response = await fetch(`https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/${ipfsHash}`)
  return response.json()
}

// Update smart contract with IPFS reference
const registerAgent = async (agentId, ipfsHash) => {
  await agentRegistry.registerAgent(agentId, ipfsHash, {
    gasLimit: 500000
  })
}
```

This IPFS integration ensures that agent data is stored in a decentralized manner while maintaining fast access through Pinata's pinning service. The smart contracts only store IPFS hashes, keeping on-chain storage costs minimal while preserving immutability and censorship resistance.

- **Agents can inherit proofs** from each other while maintaining privacy through zero-knowledge verification
- **Payment layer handles microtransactions** seamlessly without requiring user accounts
- **SGX ensures secure execution** in untrusted environments
- **Akash Network provides** decentralized compute infrastructure
- **CDP Wallet enables** programmable revenue distribution
- **Amazon Nova integration** optimizes compute costs and performance

Each component can be deployed independently on Akash Network, creating a resilient and scalable decentralized agent platform that incentivizes quality through economic mechanisms and cryptographic proofs.
